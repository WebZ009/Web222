            <p class="learned">My involvement in the Course WEB222 was perfect. I gained tons of useful knowledge in it as I learned JavaScript, CSS, HTML and the DOM interface.When I assignments
                I faced a lot of difficulties and I solved them, this improved my knowledge and experience a lot about Web Development and I learned a lot things out of the Course.
                The practice sets (assignments) was perfect to teach students.
                This Course was a basic course yet at the same time, I gained some significant experience of fascinating things about web programming. This course has helped me a lot in
                the field of Web Advancement as I have the option to plan a site and even function admirably in it. All things considered, my opportunity for growth
                was perfect as I took in the essentials of Web Improvement as it would help me in working at a more significant level as it was the starting course
                would investigate more about this field of study. I desire to have a more definite information on the field of web advancement and as I loved this
                field and appreciated it, I will attempt to get as much data and information as I could in my higher examinations. It was actually an extraordinary base for me in
                the field of Web Advancement.</p>
